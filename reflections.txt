1. This gem uses Ruby's metaprogramming capabilities in the self.create_colors method in colorizr.rb by using define_method to dynamically generate all the color method as opposed to generating each color individually.

2. I spent roughly two hours working on this project.

3. The most rewarding challenge was getting my markdown formatting to be on point. Earlier, I'd constantly push to keep checking updates to my README but during this project, I came across an npm package that allows me to preview the README without having to push to Github constantly.

4. I feel like I still have a lot of room to grow. Specially in terms of refactoring my code and also on optimizing it.
